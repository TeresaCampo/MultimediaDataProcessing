# 🎓 Multimedia Data Processing Projects

Welcome to the **Multimedia Data Processing** course repository!  
This repository contains my personal implementations and assignments developed during the university course focused on the **compression and processing of textual, image, audio, and video data**.

## Course Overview

The course covers a wide range of multimedia topics, including:

- 📄 **Text Compression** (e.g., Huffman coding, Elias codes)
- 🖼️ **Image Compression** (e.g., JPEG, predictive methods)
- 🔊 **Audio Compression** (e.g., PCM, DPCM, MP3 principles)
- 🎞️ **Video Compression** (e.g., motion estimation, inter-frame prediction)

The emphasis is on **understanding the fundamentals** and implementing them in **C/C++**.
